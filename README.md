# ffx_Dodge_Lightning
A short python notebook to dodge without any skill the 200 lightning bolts of the lightning plain in Final Fantasy X.

## Brightness setting:

If your system's colometry is brighter or darker than mine, it may not work correctly for you, the value you should modify is WHITE_THRESHOLD.

If the “c” key is never pressed then you should lower it, if it is constantly pressed whether there are rays or not, raise it (0 is the minimum and 255 is the maximum).

## Side notes

I did this just for fun, I spent many hours in my childhood dodging lightning bolts on the PS2. It might not work on your system due not only to brightness, but also latencies (especially if you have a very old and slow PC that is barely able to run the game correctly), you could try then adjust SUBSAMPLE_STEP.
